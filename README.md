# Game: OCEAN

![Unity: 2020.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/unity-2020.3-yellow)

A top-down, colorful Role Playing Game with scientific value made in Unity for
practical project course at The University of Applied Sciences (HTW) Berlin, Germany.

After a shipwreck you find yourself on a tiny island surrounded by water. Luckily
someone from a nearby, bigger island noticed you floating there in your bright
life vest. They would like to bring you to main island, as there is a ship
which might bring you home. But, without any money or other goods to trade with
how are you going to pay the fare. Maybe there is another way for you to earn
the boat trip, so go and see what the island inhabitants have in store for you!

Your initial goal is getting home, but that might depend on what you call home.

## Scientific value
This game was made as a gamification of personality tests, aiming to make
the process of these tests fun and context-rich, yet accurate. 

The point distribution and results are based on the Big Five Personality Markers
by Lewis R. Goldberg. These Five Markers are:
* **Openness:** how a person is open to new ideas
* **Conscientiousness:** self control, act dutifully
* **Extroversion:** energy creation from external means, being comfortable in public
* **Agreeableness:** general concern for social harmony
* **Neuroticism:** tendency to experience negative emotions

and they describe the base markers at which the human personality can be measured at.
(See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) or
[Goldberg's site](https://ipip.ori.org/) for more detailed information).

By adding all the points from the questions in the questionnaire or the quests in the game
respectively, you get a range of points which you can normalize and compare
(detailed [scoring instructions](https://ipip.ori.org/newScoringInstructions.htm)).
