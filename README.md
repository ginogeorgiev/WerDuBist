# Game: OCEAN

![Unity: 2020.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/unity-2020.3-yellow)

A top-down, colorful Role Playing Game with scientifical value made in Unity for
practical project course at The University of Applied Sciences (HTW) Berlin, Germany.

After a shipwreck you find yourself on a tiny island surrounded by water. Luckily
someone from a nearby, bigger island noticed you floating there in your bright
life vest. They would like to bring you to main island, as there is a ship
which might bring you home. But, without any money or other goods to trade with
how are you going to pay the fare. Maybe there is another way for you to earn
the boat trip, so go and see what the island inhabitants have in store for you!

Your initial goal is getting home, but that might depend on what you call home.
